IDEAS:
- I should come up with a way to look at low bid items that are worth a lot more.... do this by adding it to your watchlist.... then have a program that auto opens a page with 1 min left
- try 1 2 punching (I place first bid at .99... then dad places bid at 1.01) and see if it gets better results because people see it as 2 bidders not 1
