need to create a bidding schedule
+ figure out roughly how many auctions end each day (do this by pulling all items from dcsports cards tonight)
+ Come up with a list of cards that you should check for daily


... you could just run the integration every week night at 10 PM for the no brainers...... then do the subjective shit every Friday from 10 PM - Saturday 6 PM










ALSO 
I should come up with a way to look at low bid items that are worth a lot more
do this by adding it to your watchlist.... then have a program that auto opens a page with 1 min left
